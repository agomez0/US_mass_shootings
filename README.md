# Mass Shootings in the U.S.

## Goal:
We are analyzing data on mass shootings in the U.S. using Python Pandas, the matplotlib library,gmaps library, and Google APIs. Our goal is to prove or disprove our hypotheses that the number of mass shooting victims is related to the location of the shooting, as well as the type of gun used. Our second hypothesis is that the amount of mass shootings in the U.S. is determined by location type and geographic location.
