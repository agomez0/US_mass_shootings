## Goal:

We are analyzing data on mass shootings in the U.S. using Python Pandas, the matplotlib library, gmaps library, and Google APIs. Our goal is to prove or disprove our hypothesis that the number of mass shooting victims is related to the location of the shooting, as well as the type of gun used. We believe that there are less victims when the shooting occurs in close proximity to the nearest police department. Furthermore, we believe that there are more mass shooting victims when multiple weapons are used or when more powerful weapons are used than when a handgun is used. Our second hypothesis is that the amount of mass shootings in the U.S. is determined by location type and geographic location. We specifically believe that most mass shootings occur in crowded places, such as schools, as apposed to homes.
